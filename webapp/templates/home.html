    <h2>Welcome to <b>PolyOligo</b> <small>v0.1</small> <h4> - a suite for designing oligonucleotides on polyploid and complex genomes.</h4></h2><br><br>

            <h4><b>Important information</b></h4>
            PolyOligo is available open-source with a command line interface <b><a href="https://github.com/MirkoLedda/polyoligo">HERE</a></b>. The standalone version can be used with any reference genome and VCF file, has more features and is faster because multi-core enabled.<br><br>
            To avoid overloading the server and transferring large amount of data, most methods come with limitations here. Notably, only a limited number of reference genomes are made available (current list:
            <select name="reference">
                {% for blastdb_option in blastdb_options %}
                    <option value= "{{blastdb_option}}" SELECTED>{{blastdb_option}}</option>"
                {% endfor %}
            </select>
            - more can be added upon <a href="">request</a>), the number of concurrent designs is capped and mutations from a VCF file cannot be considered (excl. strawberries).<br><br>
